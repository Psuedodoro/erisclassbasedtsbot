# Eris Class-Based Discord Bot
This is, as it says in the name of the repo: an example structure of a Discord bot made in TypeScript with an OOP based approach to making Discord Bots.

Some code I have used from my NecroAssistant bot (made in discord.js), however I recently have been finding that Eris/ErisJS is more lightweight and better for TypeScript users with a more first-class TypeScript support.
